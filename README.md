# MidpointRule
Simple Program to calculate the integral by midpoint rule, here the function e^(âˆ’x^2) is used with the interval [0,1]

You can easily change the function and interval in the code according to your liking.

The program also plots a graph of the absolute error according with the chosen number of subintervals
